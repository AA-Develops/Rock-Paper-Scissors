# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors command line game that I made. In this repository, there should be two files, `Rock_Paper_Scissors.py` and `rps_point_system.py`. `Rock_Paper_Scissors.py` is the game which allows you to have infinte plays. However, `rps_point_system.py` is the game which allows you to only have 10 plays. This version also comes with a point system.

## How to Play (Rock_Paper_Scissors.py)
- [ ] Go to your command line
- [ ] Clone this repository
- [ ] Change Directory (cd) to the folder where you cloned the repository
- [ ] To run the game, type: `python3 Rock_Paper_Scissors.py`
- [ ] Since the game is running on a while loop, you must use `Control + C` to stop the program

## How to Play (rps_point_system.py)
- [ ] Go to your command line
- [ ] Clone this repository
- [ ] Change Directory (cd) to the folder where you cloned the repository
- [ ] To run the game, type: `python3 rps_point_system.py`
    * Since this game has a limited amount of plays, you do not need to use `Control + C` to stop it
